Say goodbye to outdated appraisals and hello to transparent, market-driven insights for smarter real estate decisions.

## ✨ Features

🏠 **Property Registration** – Securely register properties with geospatial hashes and ownership proofs  
📊 **Real-Time Valuations** – Integrate oracle-fed market data for instant, accurate pricing  
🔗 **Oracle Integration** – Pull live data from trusted sources like Zillow APIs or MLS feeds via decentralized oracles  
💰 **Escrow & Transactions** – Automate deals with valuation-based escrows and conditional releases  
⚖️ **Dispute Resolution** – Challenge valuations through on-chain arbitration with staking  
👥 **User Roles** – Multi-role system for owners, buyers, appraisers, and validators  
📈 **Historical Analytics** – Track valuation trends and generate reports for investors  
🔒 **Privacy Controls** – Optional zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive property details  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Property Owners**

- Hash your property deed and details (address, sq ft, features)  
- Call `register-property` on the PropertyRegistry contract with the hash, metadata, and your STX wallet  
- Request a valuation via `submit-valuation-request` – oracles fetch real-time comps, ZRI indices, and local market data  
- Receive an on-chain valuation report in minutes!  

**For Buyers & Investors**

- Query `get-property-valuation` for any registered property using its unique ID  
- Simulate deals with `calculate-escrow` based on current valuation and terms  
- Initiate a purchase: Lock funds in the Escrow contract, which releases only if valuation thresholds are met  
- Dive into trends with `fetch-historical-data` for portfolio analysis  

**For Appraisers & Validators**

- As an approved oracle node, submit data feeds to the ValuationOracle contract  
- Stake tokens in the DisputeResolution contract to mediate challenges  
- Earn rewards for accurate submissions via the RewardsDistributor
